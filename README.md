## Development Strategy

New features and significant changes for `MyFinanceTracker` will be developed in dedicated feature branches, ensuring that the `main` branch remains stable and always deployable.

### Workflow:
1.  **Branching:** For each new feature or significant enhancement, a new branch will be created (e.g., `feature/your-feature-name`) from the `main` branch.
2.  **Development:** All work related to that feature will occur on its dedicated branch.
3.  **Integration:** Once a feature is complete and reviewed, it will be merged back into the `main` branch.
